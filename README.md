# AntSimulator

# Can manually hardcode walls for ants to travel around

# Can remove walls by shift+left clicking cose to the center of the wall

# Pressing 'p' will make an alert that temporarilty pauses the simulation

# 2 possible types of colonies, sugar or fire ants

# Each colony contains its own pheromones and ants

# The toFood pheromones for each colonies ants match the color of the ant, the other color of pheromone is for the toHome pheromones

# When ants cannot see pheromones, food, or the colony, they randomly wander

# When an ant has food they will look for weakest toHome pheromones to find their way back to the colony

# When an ant doesn't have food they will look for the strongest toFood pheromone to find their way to the the food

# Pheromones slowly evaporate off and the pheromone objects are removed from the colonies list once their life is less than 0
